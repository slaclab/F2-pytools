        The indexing that comes from the DAQ is a linear list of all matched data that doesn't indicate step.
        So if you have a data set that has 2 steps of three shots each the DAQ tells you to use
        idx = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (python counting, the conversion from matlab counting is handled elsewhere.)
        The images for each step are stored in separate HDF5 files, and each file will start counting at 0.

        This function splits up the matched indices by step and stores them in a list for easy access later.
        In the above example the list that is stored is [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]
